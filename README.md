# Research Track 2 (RT2) Assignments

This repository contains three assignments for the Research Track 2 (RT2) course. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of robotics and data analysis, ranging from enhanced documentation to interactive user interfaces and statistical performance comparisons.

## Table of Contents
- [Assignment 1: Enhanced Documentation](#assignment-1-enhanced-documentation)
- [Assignment 2: Interactive Jupyter Notebook Interface](#assignment-2-interactive-jupyter-notebook-interface)
- [Assignment 3: Statistical Analysis](#assignment-3-statistical-analysis)

## Assignment 1: Enhanced Documentation

This assignment builds upon the second assignment from the previous semester, with the main addition being comprehensive documentation using Sphinx. The documentation is designed to provide a detailed overview of the code, its functionality, and usage instructions.

### Key Features
- **Sphinx Documentation**: Detailed documentation generated using Sphinx.
- **GitHub Pages**: The documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.

### Accessing the Documentation
The generated documentation is available [here](https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name).

## Assignment 2: Interactive Jupyter Notebook Interface

This assignment involves creating a Jupyter Notebook-based user interface for the second assignment of the RT1 course. The goal is to replace the existing user interface node with an interactive notebook that provides real-time information about the robot's position.

### Key Features
- **Widgets for User Interaction**: The notebook utilizes Jupyter widgets to enhance user interaction.
- **Real-Time Position Visualization**: The robot's position and path to target positions are visualized in real-time.
- **Target Status Indicators**: Reached targets are marked with green squares, while not-reached targets are marked with red Xs.

### How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `RT2_Assignment2.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to interact with the robot's position data.

## Assignment 3: Statistical Analysis

This assignment involves performing a statistical analysis to compare the performance of two code implementations for the first assignment of the RT1 course: my code and my colleague's code.

### Key Features
- **Performance Comparison**: Statistical methods are used to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of the two code implementations.
- **Detailed Analysis**: The analysis includes various metrics and visualizations to support the comparison.

### How to Use
1. Review the Jupyter Notebook `RT2_Assignment3_Statistical_Analysis.ipynb`.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to understand the performance comparison.
